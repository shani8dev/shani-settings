# check-pam-drift.sh — verify our etc/pam.d/system-auth is still in sync with
# the pambase file it forks.
#
# Why this exists: shani-settings ships its own /etc/pam.d/system-auth so that
# `auth sufficient pam_u2f.so` is actually loaded (no stock PAM stack referenced
# pam_u2f, so a FIDO2/U2F key was installed and inert). That makes our file a
# fork of a distro-owned one, and the fork drifts silently — pambase's own
# upgrade does not touch our file, so a pambase bump that changes the login
# stack leaves the two disagreeing with nothing to notice. That is not
# cosmetic: this file governs the auth stack for every graphical login and for
# sudo/su, so a missed upstream change is a silently divergent auth policy.
#
# What it compares: the significant (non-comment, non-blank) lines, with our one
# added pam_u2f line removed. Anything left over is upstream drift we have not
# carried over.
#
# Usage: bash tests/check-pam-drift.sh [path/to/our/system-auth]
#   Defaults to etc/pam.d/system-auth in this repo.
# Requires pambase installed (provides /etc/pam.d/system-auth to compare against).
